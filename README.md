## Description
RESTful API built with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB (via Prisma), implementing essential HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to manage user data efficiently.

This project demonstrates how to create a clean and scalable backend service that enables full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, ideal for modern web and mobile applications requiring dynamic and flexible data handling.
